# **OP3 SIMULATOR**

This ROS package is a simulation platform for OP3 Robot. It is developed to directly work with the ROS interface developed by Robotis making the transition from simulation to implementation easier.

## **Dependencies**

1. MuJoCo (>2.1.2)

Install the latest version with this command:

`$ pip install mujoco`

2. Viewer for MuJoCo in Python [repo](https://github.com/rohanpsingh/mujoco-python-viewer)

Single line install

`$ pip install mujoco-python-viewer`

## **Package Installation**

Clone the repository to your workspace.

`$ git clone https://github.com/govind-aadithya/OP3_Mujoco_Simulator.git`

'catkin_make op3_mujoco' or 'catkin build op3_mujoco'


## **Run Simulator**

Set rosparam to use sim time with /clock topic

`$  rosparam set /use_sim_time "true"`

Use ros run to run the node. 

`$  rosrun op3_mujoco RosPy_PostitionControl_V2_2.py`

Note: chmod should be done before rosrun (chmod +x ~filepath/finename)

(Current stable version of the code is V2_2.py. Replace this with the most recent version while running.)
